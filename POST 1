<p id="first-graph">Jennifer Smithfield felt weak and still had trouble breathing in February after nearly two weeks with covid-19. It was a Sunday, and her doctor’s office was closed. So her primary care physician suggested going to an emergency room to be safe.</p>

<p>Smithfield went to HCA Healthcare’s flagship hospital, near its corporate headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee, and thought she would be checked out and sent home. But that’s not what happened.</p>

<p>“Even though I did not feel well, I didn’t think it was bad enough to be hospitalized, especially not multiple days,” Smithfield said.</p>

<p>Over three days, Smithfield racked up $40,000 in charges for her inpatient stay and received a bill for $6,000 under the terms of her health insurance policy. “I could have walked out,” Smithfield said. “I wish I had walked out.”</p>

<p>While she was in the hospital, she said, the doctor who had directed her to the ER texted her repeatedly, asking why she’d been admitted.</p>

<p>For more than a decade, large health systems have faced scrutiny for admitting patients to costly hospital stays when less expensive treatments or short periods of observation in the ER would have been appropriate.</p>
